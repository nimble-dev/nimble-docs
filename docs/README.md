NIMBLE developer notes
===============

GitHub pages feature requires that the content start at index.html in the /docs directory of master branch (or a couple of other options).

The Makefile will render an Rmd into html using rmarkdown.

When you add a page, simply add a link to it in index.Rmd and rebuild index.html.
